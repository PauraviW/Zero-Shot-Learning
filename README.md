# Can C2C-Siamese Networks be used for outlier detection and Zero Shot Learning?

Notebooks:
- A2_Joint Training_MIST.ipynb : This notebook demonstrates the joint training of semantic embeddings with images. 
- ZSL_MNIST.ipynb : This notebook evaluates the handcrafted attributes by performing Zero Shot Learning on MNIST data. This uses a 2-layer CNN to perform Zero Shot Learning.
- OutlierDetection.ipynb : This notebook demonstrates the use of C2C-SN for performing outlier detection using MNIST.
- ZeroShotLearning.ipynb : This notebook demonstrates the attempt to perform ZSL using C2C-SN on MNIST and the handcrafted_attributes.
- Zero Shot Learning AWA2.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the ZSL on AWA2 dataset.
